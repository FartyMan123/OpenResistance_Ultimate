# Architecture

Tracks the architecture of Open Resistance: its systems, sub-systems, and how they fit together. Update this file whenever a system is added, removed, or changes shape.

Status tags: **Planned** (designed, not built) · **In progress** · **Implemented**.

## Mod structure

### AR-Open-Resistance (CORE MOD)

All the scripts and functionality, plus templates for base-game assets.

- Lives in this repo: `AROpenResistance/Open Resistance/` (addon ID `OpenResistance`, GUID `6AA282336705EED2`).
- Class prefix: `AROR_` for all core classes, enums, and globals (e.g. `AROR_LocationComponent`). Reserved for the core mod.
- Depends only on the base game (`ArmaReforger`, `58D0FB3206B6F859`). It must stay playable on its own.
- Provides:
  - every game mode system (see [Systems](#systems))
  - template prefabs and configs built from base-game assets (locations, spawn points, factions, loadouts, AI groups) that extender mods can inherit from or replace
  - the extension points that extender mods use

### Extender Mods (made by others)

Separate addons, maintained by others, that add extra content such as maps, weapons, vehicles, scripts, functions, missions etc.

- Each one lists the core mod (`6AA282336705EED2`) as a dependency in its `addon.gproj`.
- Extends the core by:
  - inheriting from core template prefabs and configs
  - supplying their own configs (factions, loadouts, location data for new maps, missions)
  - subclassing core `AROR_` classes, or using `modded class` where needed
- Uses its own class prefix, never `AROR_`, so names don't collide with the core or with other extenders.
- The core must never depend on, or reference, an extender mod.

## Systems

Add each system here as it is designed or built, using the template at the end of this section.

### Game Mode — In progress
Purpose: the game mode entity every map places; all core systems hang off it as components.

Key classes/prefabs/configs:
- `Prefabs/GameModes/AROR_GameMode_Base.et`: inherits the base-game `GameMode_Plain.et` (`SCR_BaseGameMode`). Core system components are added here.
- A custom game mode script class will be added when game mode logic is needed.

Server/client: standard `SCR_BaseGameMode` replication.

Extension points: extender mods can inherit `AROR_GameMode_Base.et` to add or swap components.

Sub-systems (Planned):
- Game mode rules for the Resistance gameplay loop (to be defined).
- A playable world also needs faction manager, loadout manager and spawn point entities; these will be part of the map template.

### Locations — In progress
Purpose: named areas on the map (**Town**, placed in the world; **HQ**, spawned at runtime) that other systems use to decide where things happen (start location, AI, objectives).

Key classes/prefabs/configs:
- `AROR_LocationComponent`: on each placed location. Name, type and a per-location radius set in the World Editor.
- `AROR_LocationManagerComponent`: on the game mode. Registry of all locations; other systems query locations through it.
- `AROR_ELocationType`: location types (currently `TOWN`).
- `Prefabs/Locations/AROR_Location_Base.et` → `AROR_Location_Town.et`: town template. `AROR_Location_HQ.et`: a base-game spawn point entity with the location component (type HQ) and Persistence.
- Map icons (planned): each location prefab names its own map icon (image in our addon); `AROR_LocationMapIconsComponent` on the game mode draws them (Map Markers layer 1).

Server/client: towns are static world entities and HQs are replicated dynamic entities; both register on server and clients. Location state (control status, active/inactive) will be server-owned and replicated when added.

Depends on: Map Templates (for placement).

Extension points:
- New location types via `modded enum AROR_ELocationType` plus a prefab inheriting `AROR_Location_Base.et`.
- Extender maps place `AROR_Location_*` prefabs in their own sub-scene.

Sub-systems (Planned):
- Town state (e.g. who controls the town).
- Optional hand-placed child points (spawn, garrison, objective); fall back to scanning buildings inside the radius.
- Default name from the nearest base-game map descriptor.
- Workbench plugin to auto-place towns on a terrain.

### Game Flow — In progress
Purpose: the lifecycle from world boot to play, separating **scenario data** (from the world, never saved) from **playthrough data** (from a save).

Phases (mapped onto the base-game game mode states PREGAME → GAME → POSTGAME):
1. **Scenario load**: world boots, locations register, base location markers appear. No save involved.
2. **Setup** (PREGAME): the **server admin** sees the setup screen. Options: create a new playthrough (custom settings + pick the start location on the map) or load an existing one. Non-admin players see a "waiting for admin" screen. A server config fallback (auto-load latest / named save / new with defaults) lets dedicated servers start unattended.
   - **Setup UI** is built from base-game **configurable dialogs** (`SCR_ConfigurableDialogUi`) using our own dialog presets config, content layouts and handler classes. No base-game config (e.g. the menu registry `chimeraMenus.conf`) is overridden, so it cannot conflict with game updates or other mods. `AROR_SetupUIComponent` (client, on the game mode) drives it: "New" opens the base-game map menu, the admin clicks the HQ position and a dialog confirms it (validity checked client-side, re-checked by the server); "Load" steps through the saves sent by the server. Presets live in `Configs/UI/AROR_SetupDialogs.conf`.
3. **Playthrough load**: new → generate fresh state from settings + start location; load → restore state from the save. State markers are drawn. Transition to GAME.
4. **Running**: state changes are autosaved (see Persistence).

Pre-game is held by `AROR_GameFlowComponent`, our pre-game state component on the game mode (the base game skips PREGAME unless such a component exists); it allows the move to GAME only once a playthrough has been created or loaded, and keeps player controls disabled until then.

**Staging spawn** (Antistasi-style): each map places one `AROR_StagingSpawn.et` (spawn point + `AROR_StagingSpawnComponent`). While no playthrough exists, players spawn there as the Resistance and can move freely; the admin picks the HQ from there. Once a playthrough exists (new or loaded) the staging spawn is disabled; on a new playthrough every player is teleported to the HQ (keeping their gear).

**Resistance HQ**: the start choice. On "New", the admin picks a spot on the map and the server spawns the Resistance HQ there. Players always spawn at the HQ. The HQ is a **dynamic location** (location type `HQ`): a spawned entity that carries the location component and the Resistance spawn point, so it shows up through the location registry and markers like any town, and is saved through entity persistence (*Register Dynamic*).

Settings:
- Chosen at setup, stored in the save, and **editable mid-playthrough** by the admin.
- Each setting is flagged *applies immediately* or *applies at the next cycle*; systems listen for a settings-changed event.
- Defaults and presets come from a core config that server admins and extender mods can override.

Server/client: the server owns phase transitions, settings and all generated state. Admin actions are client → server RPCs checked against base-game admin roles.

Depends on: Game Mode, Locations, Persistence.

Extension points: systems hook into lifecycle events (scenario ready, playthrough created, playthrough loaded, settings changed).

### Persistence — Planned
Purpose: unlimited, persistent playthrough saves.

- Built on the **base-game save system** (`SaveGameManager` plus entity persistence), not the community Enfusion Database/Persistence Framework mods, so the core mod depends only on the base game.
- Base-game model: a **playthrough** (one campaign) contains numbered **save points** (manual, auto, scripted, shutdown). Saves belong to a **mission**, so each map needs a mission header and its saves are kept separate automatically. Version compatibility checks come built in.
- **Limits**: the engine caps playthroughs and save points at about 101 each per mission, so old auto-saves need pruning. Saves carry no custom metadata, so a settings summary in the save list would need our own small index.
- **Boot rule**: if a save is active when the world loads, restore it and go straight to GAME (to verify); otherwise enter setup. Starting a new playthrough happens in the running world, with no reload (verified). It writes an initial save point straight away, so new and loaded games share one restore path.
- **Saving must be enabled for the scenario**: running the bare world in Workbench reports saving disabled. It is expected to come from the mission header (Save Types) and/or the world systems config (under investigation).
- **Where our data lives: inside the base-game save, via entity persistence. No separate save files.** Entities with the engine `Persistence` component are saved; the game mode already has it.
  - **Playthrough-wide state** (settings, start location, etc.) lives in our components on the game mode.
  - **Per-location state** (e.g. who controls a town) lives on the location entities, which get a `Persistence` component when they need it.
  - Each `AROR_` component with saved state has a matching serializer (`ScriptedComponentSerializer`, as base-game components do). Serializers write a version number first, so older saves keep loading after the data changes.
- Locations are referenced by a **stable location ID**, never by list position or entity reference. Saved data for a location that no longer exists is skipped with a warning.
- **Each system owns its save section** via three hooks: initialise fresh / restore from save / write to save. Extender mods add saved data the same way.
- Save **generated results**, not random seeds, so saves survive map and code changes.
- Server-only writes: periodic autosave, on key events (e.g. town captured, settings changed), and on shutdown.

### Factions — Planned
Purpose: the sides in play, referenced by **role** so the actual factions are configurable.

- Roles: `RESISTANCE`, `OCCUPIERS`, `INVADERS` (role enum, `AROR_` prefixed). Code only ever refers to roles, never to faction keys like "FIA".
- A role → faction config maps each role to a faction key. Default: Resistance → **FIA**, Occupiers → **USSR**, Invaders → **US**.
- `Prefabs/Managers/AROR_FactionManager.et` (inherits the base-game `FactionManager_Editor.et`: US, USSR, FIA, CIV) and `AROR_LoadoutManager.et` (inherits the empty `LoadoutManager_Base.et`; holds only the Resistance loadout) are placed in every map as part of the map template.
- `Prefabs/Characters/AROR_Character_Resistance_Base.et`: the Resistance player character (inherits the base-game FIA rifleman, which carries a map and compass).
- Resistance loadouts: the Resistance role's loadouts are the only ones offered; each includes a map and compass.
- Extension points: extender mods or server admins swap factions by overriding the config.

### Map Markers — In progress
Two layers:
1. **Location markers** (scenario load): **our own icon widgets** drawn on any open map (player map, deploy screen, setup screen) by a client-only component that follows the base-game map events (open/close/pan/zoom) and positions icons from world coordinates. Each location prefab chooses its icon image (white on transparent, so it can be tinted). No base-game config overrides, not draggable, no replication or saving. The HQ also keeps its spawn point map descriptor for the deploy screen.
2. **State** (playthrough load): location state is shown on the **same icon**, e.g. a town icon tinted by its controlling role (the faction's own colour, so it follows the Factions config). The control state is server-owned, replicated and saved on the location; each client re-tints its icon when it changes. Icons can also handle hover and click (used by the setup screen).

### Map Templates — Planned
Purpose: per-map setup of the game mode, as a sub-scene of the terrain's world.

- Core ships a template layout: game mode entity (with `AROR_LocationManagerComponent`), starting bases, and a `Locations` layer.
- One sub-scene per map with its own mission header. First map: **Everon** (`Worlds/AROR_Everon/`).
- Extender map mods create a sub-scene of their own terrain and place location prefabs; no code needed.
